# unit-4-game

This game is called Crystal Collector.
There is a random number generated by the computer displayed on the screen.
There are four buttons displayed on the screen.
Each button also has a random number, but hidden and only able to be seen when the button is clicked.
You must click the buttons until you have matched the computer score.
If you go over, you lose and the game resets.

I used jQuery with this game. It was fairly easier than the Word Guess game. But still difficult. I first had trouble with the positioning of different things in the game, mainly within the functions themselves. 
Slowly getting better with using functions and scope of variables and such.
